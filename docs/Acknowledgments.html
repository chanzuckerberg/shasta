<p>
The Shasta software uses the external software packages listed below.
This list does not include standard components of the 
<a href='https://www.ubuntu.com/'>Ubuntu</a> distribution 
of the 
<a href='https://www.linux.org/'>Linux</a> operating system.

<p>
Licensing information for each of these packages is contained in the Shasta 
<a href='https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta/blob/master/LICENSE'>LICENSE</a> file.



<h3> MurmurHash2</h3>
<p>
<a href='https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/blob/master/src/MurmurHash2.cpp'>MurmurHash2</a>
 from GitHub repository
<a href='https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher'>aappleby/smhasher</a>, by Austin Appleby,
is a hash function with excellent performance and randomness properties.
It is used as a hash function in the Shasta software. 



<h3 id=Dset>Dset</h3>
<p>
Files 
<a href='https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta/blob/master/src/dset64.hpp'>src/dset64.hpp</a>
and
<a href='https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta/blob/master/src/dset64-gccAtomic.hpp'>src/dset64-gccAtomic.hpp</a>
are modified versions of file 
<a href='https://github.com/wjakob/dset/blob/master/dset.h'>dset.h</a>
from GitHub repository
<a href='https://github.com/wjakob/dset'>wjakob/dset</a> 
by Wenzel Jakob. 

They are lock-free implementation in C++ of the algorithm described in <i>Wait-free Parallel Algorithms for the Union-Find Problem</i>
by Richard J. Anderson and Heather Woll, 
<i>STOC '91 Proceedings of the twenty-third annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing</i>.

<p>
The code was modified to support the union-find algorithm for 64-bit data 
using 128-bit primitives for atomic memory access.
Kind assistance by Wenzel Jakob in making these changes is acknowledged.



<h3> SeqAn</h3>
<p>
The <a href='https://github.com/seqan/seqan'>SeqAn</a> software 
is used as an option for multiple sequence alignment
of sequences encountered in edges of the Shasta marker graph.
It is not directly included in the Shasta repository.
Instead, it is downloaded from GitHub and installed on the user's machine
when the user invokes
<a href='https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta/blob/master/scripts/InstallPrerequisites-Ubuntu.sh'>
scripts/InstallPrerequisites-Ubuntu.sh</a>.
It is
