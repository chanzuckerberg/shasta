    <h1>Running Shasta using Docker</h1>

    <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> is a tool that allows users to run software on a variety
    of operating systems without installing dependencies or compiling the software.
    It uses operating-system-level virtualization to run pre-compiled images in
    self-contained packages called containers.

    Running Shasta via this method has the advantage of portability, but <a href="BuildingFromSource.html">building</a>
    the executable from source on the host machine is still the most performant method of running Shasta.


    <h3>Getting Started</h3>

    To run Shasta via the Docker image, the Docker software must be <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/">installed</a>
    on the host OS.  Hardware and data requirements for <a href=Running.html>running</a> Shasta still apply.

    The command to run the image includes configuration to
    mount the current working directory to the <code>data/</code>
    directory inside the container.  The read data
    (<code>input.fasta</code> in this example)
    must be present in the current directory,
    and all the output will be there after execution.
    The image name and version tag must be specified, followed by
    any arguments that would be passed to the Shasta executable:

    <pre>docker run -v `pwd`:/data kishwars/shasta:latest --input input.fasta</pre>

    When Shasta is run via this method, the Docker image is set up to save the command, all output logged to the console,
    and the time and maximum memory usage to a file called <code>shasta.log</code>.  This log will be present in the
    current working directory, alongside all output from Shasta.  The Docker image will be automatically downloaded
    the first time it is used; subsequent runs will use a cached version.

    <h3>Memory Mode</h3>

    To run Shasta in the <code>filesystem</code> memory mode (for better <a href=Performance.html>performance</a>),
    the Docker container needs to set up underlying infrastructure in the OS.
    By default, a Docker container is not allowed to take the actions necessary for this,
    so it must be given elevated privileges.
    To do this the <code>--privileged</code> flag must be set when invoking Docker:

    <pre>docker run --privileged -v `pwd`:/data kishwars/shasta:latest --input input.fasta --memoryMode filesystem --memoryBacking 2M</pre>

    When running Shasta in this mode, the <code>cleanupBinaryData</code> command is not required,
    and the binary data is not available for use with the http server or the Python API.


    <h3>Compiling Docker Image</h3>

    The Shasta image is currently published to the <code>kishwars/shasta</code> repository on
    <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/kishwars/shasta">Docker Hub</a> and does not need to be compiled locally.
    For advanced users, an image can be compiled using the Makefile in the
    <code>docker/</code> folder in the Shasta repository.

    <pre>cd docker/
make</pre>

    By default, the build script will find the current git commit in the repository
    where it is being run, create an image with the code from that commit
    (the commit must be pushed to github), then tag the image with the
    current Shasta version and the commit hash.

    To create an image from a specific git commit,
    the <code>make</code> command can be run with this option:

    <pre>make -e git_commit=&lt;your_git_commit&gt;</pre>

    In addition to <code>git_commit</code>, the specifications for <code>image_name=kishwars/shasta</code>,
    <code>shasta_version=0.1.0</code>, and <code>tag=${version}--${git_commit}</code> can be changed in the same way.
