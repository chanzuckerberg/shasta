<h2>Guidelines for contributing</h2>

<p>
Contributions of code, ideas, computational experiments,
or documentation are welcome. 
To contribute, please use the standard GitHub Pull Request process.

<p>
If you contribute C++ code, please:
<ul>
<li>Add at least a minimal amount
of comments to explain or clarify what the code does. 
<li>Use blank lines generously to separate code blocks.
<li>Set your editor to convert tabs to 4 spaces.
<li>To minimize name pollution of the global namespace,
all code should be in the <code>ChanZuckerberg::shasta</code> namespace.
Do not use <code>using</code> directives at global scope.
<li>If you need to add a large amount of code to an existing
file, consider creating a new file instead.
<li>Keep in mind that the code is currently compiled
using the C++11 standard. Use features in that standard
liberally. However, you cannot use C++ features
that were introduced in the C++14 or C++17 standard.
<li>For functionality not provided
by the standard libraries, you can also use the Boost libraries.
<li>If possible, avoid adding dependencies on other packages.
</ul>

<p>
If you contribute ideas, computational experiments,
comments, or criticism, please use the GitHub 
<a href="https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta/wiki">Wiki</a>
or 
<a href="https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta/issues">Issues</a>
sections of the GitHub repository as appropriate.

<p>
If you contribute documentation, please:
<ul>
<li>Put it in the <code>docs</code>
directory, so it becomes automatically visible in GitHub Pages.
<li>Feel free to create new <code>.html</code> files, if appropriate.
<li>Attempt to harmonize your new materials with the existing
documentation, if possible.
</ul>
