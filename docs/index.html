<h2 id=motivation>Motivation and wish list</h2>

<p>
It was  
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4060"> recently shown</a>
that <i>de novo</i> assembly for human genomes
from <a href="https://nanoporetech.com">Oxford Nanopore</a> reads
is possible, but computationally very expensive and laborious.
The aim of this project is to
enable <i>de novo</i> assembly of human genomes
on a routine/production basis and at reasonable 
computational cost.

For this to be possible, <i>de novo</i> assembly must be:

<ul>
<li>Fast: under one day elapsed time.
<li>Accurate: accuracy and other assembly metrics must be
comparable to those provided by existing tools.
Assembly accuracy should be limited by data quality,
not by assembly algorithms.
<li>Logistically simple and easy to run. 
</ul>

<p>
This project is at an early stage. Its main output is currently
in the form of a <i>marker graph</i>, not assembled sequence. 
It does include functionality to extract and display a
local portion of the global marker graph, 
and to use it to assemble sequence using a simple-minded
algorithm.




<h2 id=approach>Computational approach</h2>

<p>
See <a href=ShastaSlides-June2018-v2.pdf>this presentation</a>
for information on the computational methods currently being explored. 
In addition to Oxford Nanopore reads, these methods might also apply 
to long reads from other technologies, such as the
<a href="https://www.pacb.com/">Pacific Biosciences</a> DNA sequencing platforms.

<p>
To facilititate run logistics and code development, 
an assembly runs in memory on a single, dedicated large machine 
with a large amount of memory (&asymp; 1 TB)
and a relatively large number of processors (&asymp; 32 cores). 
Input data are copied to memory, the entire assembly runs
in memory without disk access (except for log files
and small summary files), and the output is then copied
to persistent storage. This minimizes delays due to data movement,
and facilitates algorithmic development, as all data
structures are always loaded in memory and immediately
accessible at memory speed.
In addition, it simplifies run logistics, eliminating
the need to set up and maintain a cluster with high performance 
networking and with access to a large, high performance
storage server.

<p>
The requirement for such a large machine may seem extravagant.
However, machines with these characteristics are
currently easily available at reasonable prices on the major
cloud computing platforms. 
For example, on 
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2">AWS EC2</a>, 
instance type <code>x1.16xlarge</code>,
with 976 GB of memory and 32 cores (64 "virtual processors"
because of hyperthreading)
is available at the time of writing for an hourly price around 
$7 (on demand pricing), 
$4 (reserved pricing), 
$2 (spot pricing).
And on <a href="https://cloud.google.com">Google Cloud</a>, 
machine type <code>n1-ultramem-40</code>, 
with similar characteristics,
is available at similar prices.
And machines with 1-2 TB of memory are often available
as departmental machines.



<h2 id=platforms>Supported platforms</h2>
<p>
The code is currently set up to build and run on Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 18.04.
The documentation assumes that one of these platforms is used
both for building and running the code.

<p>
Porting to other Linux systems should be relatively easy once the 
gcc problem described in the next section is fixed.
It will likely require just minor changes to the build process
(in particular, <code>cmake</code> file <code>src/CMakeLists.txt</code>). 
If you are interested in portability to a specific Linux platform,
please open a 
<a href="https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta/issues">GitHub Issue</a> 
on the repository.



<h4 id=ubuntu18Performance>Platform-dependent performance considerations</h3>
<p>
Because of  
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=80878">bug 80878</a> 
in the gcc compiler, on Ubuntu 18.04 some phases of the code
run at reduced performance. 
This will also be the case for other Linux platforms that use gcc 7.1 or later,
until the gcc bug is fixed.


<h2 id=building>Building the code from source</h2>
<p>
This section, as the rest of the documentation,
assumes that you are on an Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 machine.

<p>
If you have the necessary 
<a href=Prerequisites.html>prerequisite packages</a> installed, 
you can get a local copy of the code and build it
using the following commands: 
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta.git
mkdir shasta-build
cd shasta-build
cmake ../shasta
make all
make install
</pre>

<p>
If you are not sure if you have the necessary prerequisite packages installed, 
you can instead
use the following commands
(this assumes that you are authorized to acquire root privileges
using the <code>sudo</code> command - depending on set up you may be asked 
to enter your password):
<pre>
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta.git
sudo shasta/scripts/InstallPrerequisites-Ubuntu.sh
mkdir shasta-build
cd shasta-build
cmake ../shasta
make all
make install
</pre>




<p>
This creates in the <code>shasta-build</code> directory
a <code>shasta-install</code> directory that 
needs to be copied to the machine where the code will run
and that contains the following:

<ul>
<li>A <code>bin</code> directory containing shared library
<code>shasta.so</code> and several scripts.
<li>A <code>conf</code> directory containing sample config files.
<li>A <code>docs</code> directory containing this and other documentation. 
</ul>

<p>
If your build system has more than one processor
and enough memory, you can speed up the build using the <code>-j</code>
option in the <code>make all</code> command.

<p>
If you don't plan to use your build for debugging, you
can use command <code>make install/strip</code>
instead of <code>make install</code> as the last
step of the build process.
This will strip debug symbols from shared library
<code>shasta-install/bin/shasta.so</code>, which significantly reduces
the size of the
build directory.




<h2 id=input>Input files</h2>
<p>
The <code>shasta</code>
software uses as input one or more 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA">FASTA</a>
files containing the input reads.
If you have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ">FASTQ</a> file, 
you can convert it to FASTA using script 
<code>shasta-install/bin/FastqToFasta.py</code>.
If your FASTQ file is compressed (extension <code>.gz</code>),
you can decompress it and convert to FASTA in one step,
saving a round trip to disk, using 
script 
<code>shasta-install/bin/FastqGzToFasta.py</code>.


 
<h2 id=running>Running the assembly</h2>

<p>
There are two ways to run an assembly:
<ul>
<li>
If you just want to run a small test assembly for which 
performance is not essential, use the simpler 
procedure described 
<a href=RunningSmall.html>here</a>.
<li>
The complete assembly procedure for large runs is described 
<a href=Running.html>here</a>.
</ul>


<h2 id=inspecting>Inspecting assembly results</h2>

<p>
Currently, the only output produced by the <code>shasta</code>
software consists of various data structures stored in binary files in memory,
visible as files in the <code>data</code> and <code>Data</code> directories.
The most important such data structure is the global marker graph,
as defined <a href=ShastaSlides-June2018-v2.pdf>here</a>.
The <code>shasta</code>
software implements <code>http</code> functionality 
that allows you to inspect these data structures using a Web browser.
To do this, use the following command:

<pre>
shasta-install/bin/RunServerFromDisk.py
</pre>

This starts the <code>shasta</code> software in a mode that behaves like an 
<code>http</code> server. You can connect to it by pointing your Web browser to it.
If the browser is running on the same machine where the server is,
enter this URL in your browser:

<pre>
http://localhost:17100
</pre>

(the port number following the colon could change - see the output of the 
<code>RunServerFromDisk.py</code> command to find out what port the server is using).
If the browser is running on a different machine, you will have to replace
<code>localhost</code> in the above URL with the name or IP address
of the machine where the server is running.

<p>
Once in the browser, the server functionality should
be reasonably self-explanatory. You can look at individual reads
and their markers, and inspect the global marker graph around 
any marker associated with a vertex of the
global marker graph. The local marker graph can be shown
in a detailed format that shows the sequence associated with
each vertex and edge, or in a compact format that shows only the
graph connectivity.
You can also show the optimal spanning tree of the local marker graph
and the sequence that is assembled from it using a simple
assembly algorithm.




<h2 id=contributions>Contributions</h2>
<p>
Contributions of code, ideas, computational experiments,
or documentation are welcome. 
To contribute, please use the standard GitHub Pull Request process.
To facilitate and encourage contributions, the 
<a href=CONTRIBUTING.html>guidelines</a>
for contributing are minimal.

<p>
Comments and criticism are also welcome.
Please use the GitHub 
<a href="https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta/wiki">Wiki</a>
or 
<a href="https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta/issues">Issues</a>
sections of the GitHub repository as appropriate for these purposes.



<h2 id=python>Python API</h2>
<p>
The code is packaged as a shared library <code>shasta.so</code>
which behaves as a Python module. Python code can <code>import shasta</code>
to use the functionality provided by the module through the API 
documented 
<a href='PythonApi/_build/html/index.html'>here</a>.
For the Python interpreter to find the module you must either:
<ul>
<li>Make sure the Python script that contains <code>import shasta</code> is in the same directory
that contains <code>shasta.so</code> (for example, <code>shasta-install/bin</code>).
<li>Or, set environment variable <code>PYTHONPATH</code>
to the name of the directory that contains <code>shasta.so</code>.
</ul>
