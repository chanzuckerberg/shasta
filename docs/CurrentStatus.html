<h1>Current status</h1>

<h3>Release</h3>
<p>
<a href='https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta/releases/tag/0.1.0'>
An initial release 0.1.0
</a>
of the Shasta assembler is now available.
This initial release is functional but the documentation is incomplete in several areas, 
and lacks an evaluation of assembly accuracy.

<h3>Performance and cost</h3>
<p>
As of May 2019, the Shasta assembler is functional and is
capable of performing a human assembly at typical coverage
in a few hours on a large machine with an appropriate configuration,
using as input long reads from Oxford Nanopore flowcells.

<p>
For example,
at coverage around 60x, an AWS  
<code>x1.32xlarge</code> instance, with 128 virtual processors and 1952 GB of memory,
completes the assembly in about 5 hours.
The compute cost of such an assembly is around $20 at AWS spot market or reserved prices.

<p>
The Shasta assembler, although not designed or optimized for smaller genomes,
can also assemble bacterial genomes in minutes on a typical laptop
(e. g. 1-2 minutes for an <i>E. coli</i> assembly). 

<h3>Accuracy</h3>
<p>
An evaluation of the quality of assembled sequence is in progress.
Early indications are that,
when comparing with alternative, less performant long read assemblers,
Shasta assembly quality is comparable or better.
This evaluation is expected to be completed soon.


<h3>Assembly parameters</h3>
<p>
Default Shasta assembly parameters are optimized for coverage around 60x, 
and require reconfiguration if using much lower or much higher coverage.


<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
The Shasta assembler creates output in 
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA>FASTA</a> and 
<a href=https://github.com/GFA-spec/GFA-spec/blob/master/GFA1.md>GFA 1.0</a> formats.
It also includes an http server and a Python API 
that can be used to access and visualize
the data structures created during assembly.
This can be useful for testing or debugging,
or for studying assembler behavior at locations of interest.

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>
An overhaul of the documentation is currently in progress.

<h3>Platforms</h3>
<p>
Basic assembly functionality is provided by the Shasta executable 
which runs on most current 64-bit Linux plus macOS and Windows.
The Shasta executable has no dependencies and does not require
installation. 

<p>
Extended functionality, including a Python API that enables Python scripting
and an http server that can be used to inspect assembly details,
are only available on Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 18.04.
A script to install the necessary dependencies is
provided.

<h3>Development</h3>
<p>
The Shasta assembler is undergoing active development
and is expected to improve in accuracy, performance,
and functionality.
As an open source project, it is open to external contributions.
