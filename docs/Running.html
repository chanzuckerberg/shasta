<h1>Running an assembly</h1>

<p>
For quick start information, see <a href=QuickStart.html>here</a>.
This section provides additional background information.

<h2 id=ShastaExecutable>The Shasta executable</h2>
<p>
The Shasta executable provides the most convenient way of running
an assembly. If you downloaded it as a single file from a release on GitHub, the
executable is named <code>shasta-Linux-X.Y.Z</code> for Linux
or <code>shasta-macOS-X.Y.Z</code> for macOS. 
Here, <code>X.Y.Z</code> identifies the release.
If you build the code from source yourself, the
executable is <code>shasta-install/bin/shasta</code>.

<p>
The Shasta executable requires no installation or set up, 
and has no dependencies. The Linux version, which is statically linked,
runs on most current 64-bit Linux distributions, including
at least the following:

<ul>
<li>Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04
<li>Linux Mint 18.3
<li>CentOS 7.6
<li>Debian 9
<li>Fedora 29
</ul>

<p>
If you downloaded the executable from GitHub,
you will have to set execute permissions before running it
(the browser will not do that for you, for security reasons).
This can be done as follows:

<pre>
chmod ugo+x shasta-Linux-X.Y.Z
</pre>
or
<pre>
chmod ugo+x shasta-macOS-X.Y.Z
</pre>

<p>
You can invoke the Shasta executable without options or with
<code>--help</code> to get a description of the options.
A list of options can also be found 
<a href=CommandLineOptions.html>here</a>.
Most options control assembly parameters whose default
value works well for an assembly with typical coverage
around 60x, and don't need to be changed in many cases.

<p>
Keep in mind that these default parameter values
include a read length cutoff of 10 Kb, which means 
all reads shorter than that are discarded on input.
On current data from sequencing runs at UCSC, this result
in a very small loss in coverage.

<p>
The only mandatory options is <code>--input</code> 
which must be used to specify the input FASTA files
containing reads to be used for the assembly.
If there is more than one file, the names
should be specified separated by white space,
entering <code>--input</code> only once, like this:

<pre>
--input a.fasta b.fasta c.fasta
</pre>



<h2 id=MemoryRequirements>Memory requirements</h2>

<p>
For performance, the Shasta assembler uses a single large
machine rather than a cluster of smaller machines, 
and operates in memory,
with no access to data on disk except during
initial input of the reads, final output of the assembly,
and for small output files containing summary assembly information.
As a result, it has higher memory requirements than
comparable tools that keep some or most of their data on disk.

<p>
Memory requirements are roughly proportional
to genome size and coverage, and 
are around 5 to 8 bytes per input base.
For a human size genome (&#8776;3 Gb) at coverage 60x,
this works out to around 
1 TB of memory. 

<p>
Machine with 1 to 4 TB of memory have become available
at reasonably prices in the last few years, and they are widely available
on cloud computing platforms. 
For example, for human assemblies using Shasta, we have routinely
been using AWS <code>x1.32xlarge</code> instances with
1952 TB of memory and 128 virtual processors 
(64 cores with hyperthreading). 
These machines are available at around $13/hour as on demand
instances and they complete a typical human assembly at coverage
60x in about 6 hours, at a compute cost around $80 per assembly,
much lower than current sequencing costs to produce the input reads. 
Much lower prices (2x to 3x lower) are also available for
reserved instances and on the AWS spot market,
which means that a production facility could achieve
a compute cost around $30 per genome.

<p>
Shasta also supports a mode of operation
with data structures physically on disk,
mapped to virtual memory.
In this mode of operation, the operating system
dynamically moves pages to disk from memory and back as needed,
which can result in a huge performance penalty.
For this reason, this mode of operation is not suggested,
except in a couple of conditions:

<ul>
<li>For very small genomes.
<li>If the amount of memory available is not much smaller
than the amount required.
</ul>

<p>
Under these conditions, and if a substantial performance
penalty is tolerable, this mode of operation can be
selected using the following Shasta command line options:
<br>
<code>
--memoryMode filesystem --memoryBacking disk
</code>

<p>
See 
<a href=#MemoryModes>the next section</a>
for more information on these options.




<h2 id=MemoryModes>Memory modes</h2>

<p>
(This section does not apply to macOS).

<p>
For performance, the Shasta executable operates in memory,
with no access to data on disk except during
initial input of the reads, final output of the assembly,
and for small output files containing summary assembly information.
All large memory areas are allocated using <code>mmap</code> 
calls in one of several different modes of operation
described below. 
The choice of the optimal mode of operation is dependent
on many factors and decribed below.
The default mode of operation works reasonably well in most cases
and does not require root privilege. 
However, it does not deliver the best possible performance.

<p>
The memory modes are controlled by two command line options:

<ul>
<li><code>--memoryMode</code> controls whether <code>mmap</code>
allocates anonymous memory or memory mapped to a filesystem.
It can take one of the following values:
<ul>
<li><code>anonymous</code> (the default value)
<li><code>filesystem</code>
</ul> 

<li><code>--memoryBacking</code> specifies the physical backing
of pages allocated via <code>mmap</code> and can take
one of the following values:
<ul>
<li><code>disk</code>: <code>mmap</code> uses standard 4 KB pages
mapped to the existing filesystem on disk in the current directory.
<li><code>4K</code> (the default value): <code>mmap</code> uses standard 4 KB pages
(anonymous or on a <code>tmpfs</code> filesystem, depending
on the setting of <code>--memoryBacking</code>).
<li><code>2M</code>: <code>mmap</code> uses large 2 MB pages
(anonymous or on a <code>hugetlbfs</code> filesystem, depending
on the setting of <code>--memoryBacking</code>).
The 2MB pages are often referred to as "huge pages".
</ul>
</ul>


<p>
There are a total six possible combinations of these two options, summarized
in the table below.

<p>
In summary:
<ul>
<li>
<b>For large assemblies</b> it is best to 
make sure to have root privilege and use
<code>--memoryMode filesystem --memoryBacking 2M</code>.
Remember to use <code>shasta --command cleanupBinaryData</code>
to free up the memory when done using the binary data!

<li>
<b>For small assemblies for which performance is not important</b> 
use the default mode
<code>--memoryMode anonymous --memoryBacking 4K</code>.
However, if access to binary data is required after the assembly completes
to inspect assembly results using the http server or the Python API, use
<code>--memoryMode filesystem --memoryBacking disk</code>.
</ul>


<p>
See 
<a href=ChooseMemoryOptions.html>here</a> for interactive help to
select these options.


<h2 id=ScriptedApproaches>Scripted approaches  to running an assembly</h2>
<p>
The Shasta assembler provides a
<a href=Python.html>Python API</a> that can be used for scripting.
This makes it possible to write Python scripts to run assemblies
that have more flexibility or functionality than allowed by
the Shasta executable. 
For example, these scripts allow rerunning only a portion 
of an assembly, which can be useful for development
of new assembly functionality.

<p>
These scripts use a Python <code>import</code> to import the Shasta
shared library, <code>shasta.so</code>, which provides
Python bindings to Shasta functionality. 
The scripts and the library are in <code>shasta-install/bin</code>,
but they will normally not be needed during basic operation of 
the Shasta assembler. They are more likely to be needed
for debugging, testing, or development.

<p>
The Python API also allows you to write your own assembly scripts.
For such a script to work, and under the assumption that the
script is not located at <code>shasta-install/bin</code>,
it will be necessary to set environment variable
<code>PYTHONPATH</code> to <code>(actual path)/shasta-install/bin</code>,
so the Python interpreter can locate the Shasta shared library 
during <code>import</code>.



<h2 id=InputFiles>Input files</h2>
<p>
The Shasta
assembler uses as input one or more 
files containing reads in one of the supported formats listed below.
Shasta uses the file extension to deduce the file format, as described below.

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA">FASTA</a>:
input files in this format must be named with a file extension
<code>.fasta</code>,
<code>.fa</code>,
<code>.FASTA</code>, or
<code>.FA</code>. 
Older versions of Shasta had strict restrictions on Fasta files,
but these restrictions were eliminated. 
In particular, multiline reads are now supported.
Reads containing no-called or invalid bases are also allowed
but are discarded on input. The file can have either Unix-style (LF) or
Windows-style (CR+LF) line ends.

<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ">FASTQ</a>:
input files in this format must be named with a file extension
<code>.fastq</code>,
<code>.fq</code>,
<code>.FASTQ</code>, or
<code>.FQ</code>. 
Shasta requires the stricter FASTQ format with exactly four lines per read.
The third line must consist of just the "+" sign.
The file must have Unix-style (LF) line ends.
Windows-style (CR+LF) line ends are not supported.

<li>
Input files in an experimental and currently undocumented format 
under development to store
reads in RLE format created by the 
<a href='https://github.com/nanoporetech/flappie/blob/master/RUNNIE.md'>Oxford Nanopore Runnie base caller</a>.
File extension must be <code>.rq</code>.
</ul>

<p>
Input from compressed files is not supported.
if your input files are compressed, you have to decompress them
first using the appropriate decompression utilities.

<p>
Any reads shorter
than <code>Reads.minReadLength</code> bases (default 10000) 
present in the input files are discarded on input.
Reads that contain bases with repeat counts
greater than 255 are also discarded. 
This is a consequence of the fact that repeat counts
are stored using one byte, and therefore there would
be no way to store such reads. Reads with such
long repeat counts are extremely rare, however,
and when they occur they are of suspicious quality.



<h2 id=OutputFiles>Output files</h2>
<p>
The Shasta executable creates output in a directory with a name
specified by the <code>--assemblyDirectory</code> option (default <code>ShastaRun</code>).
The directory is created automatically at the beginning of the run. 
The run stops if the directory already exists.
This reduces the possibility of unwanted deletion of data.

<p>
Contents of the output directory after a successful run
include the following:

<ul>

<li>
<code>Assembly.fasta</code>: 
The assembly results in FASTA format.
The id of each assembled segment is the same as the
edge id of the corresponding edge in the assembly graph.

<li><code>Assembly.gfa</code>: 
The assembly results in 
<a href=https://github.com/GFA-spec/GFA-spec/blob/master/GFA1.md>GFA 1.0</a> format.
This contains the same sequences in the FASTA file (as GFA segments),
plus their connectivity information (as GFA links). 
A convenient tool to inspect and study these files is
<a href='https://rrwick.github.io/Bandage'>Bandage</a>.
Segment ids in the GFA file correspond to FASTA ids 
in the FASTA file and also to assembly graph edge ids.

<li><code>Assembly-BothStrands.gfa</code>:
An alternative GFA output file for the assembly.
This contains both strands of the assembly.
This can be useful in some cases to clarify connectivity
of assembled segments. 
See <code>AssemblySummary.csv</code> to find the 
id of the reverse complement of each assembled segment.

<li>
<code>AssemblySummary.html</code>: 
An html file summarizing many assembly metrics.
It can be viewed using an Internet browser.
It has the same content shown by the summary page
of the Shasta http server (<code>--command explore</code>).

<li><code>shasta.conf</code>: 
a configuration file containing
the values of all assembly parameters used. 
This file uses a format that can also be used as input for 
a subsequent Shasta run using option <code>--config</code>.

<li><code>ReadLengthHistogram.csv</code>:
A spreadsheet file containing statistics of the read length distribution.
This only includes reads that were used by the assembler.
The assembler discards reads shorter than 
<code>Reads.minReadLength</code> bases (default 10000)
and reads that contain bases repeated more than 255 times.
The fifth field of the last line of this file
contains the total number of input bases
used by the assembler in this run.

<li><code>Binned-ReadLengthHistogram.csv</code>:
Similar to <code>ReadLengthHistogram.csv</code>,
but using 1 Kb bins of read lengths.

<li><code>Data</code>:
A directory containing binary data
that can later be used by the Shasta http server
or with the Shasta Python API.
This is only created if option
<code>--memoryMode filesystem</code> 
was used for the run.
Keep in mind that, unless you used
option <code>--memoryBacking disk</code>,
these data are in memory, not on disk,
and will disappear at next reboot.
If you want to save them permanently, you can use
script <code>shasta-install/bin/SaveRun.py</code>
to create a copy on disk of the binary data directory named
<code>DataOnDisk</code>. 
(You can also make the copy yourself using the <code>cp</code> command).
To free up the memory used without rebooting, you can invoke the 
Shasta executable again using the following options:

<pre>
--command cleanupBinaryData --assemblyDirectory outputDirectoryName
</pre>
Here, <code>outputDirectoryName</code>
should specify the same value used in the assembly run
(that is, the name of the directory containing the <code>Data</code>
directory).
Equivalently, you can just <code>umount</code> the <code>Data</code>
directory, then remove it. 


</ul>


<h2 id=Docker>Running an assembly using Docker</h2>
<p>
It is also possible to run Shasta using Docker.
This provides additional portability and flexibility,
as well as the ability to incorporate Shasta
into workflows and computational pipelines.
See
<a href="Docker.html">here</a> for more information.
