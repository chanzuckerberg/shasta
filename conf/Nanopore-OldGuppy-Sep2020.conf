# This file contains Shasta options which attempt to partially automate
# parameter selection. It is based on an earlier config, which, as of Jun 2020,
# was known to work with Oxford Nanopore reads under the following circumstances:

# - Human genome assembly.
# - Coverage between 40x and 80x. If you have more coverage than that,
#   you can use option "--Reads.minReadLength" to adjust coverage as desired.
# - Reads from Guppy 3.0.5 base caller. Also known to work with
#   reads from other Guppy releases 3.0.x and 3.1.x.

# The automation provided by this config is particularly applicable to
# low coverage or non-human samples. It also matches or exceeds continuity
# in human samples, relative to the appropriately chosen config file.
# Updating to guppy 3.6.0 or higher will greatly improve assembly
# quality and is therefore strongly recommended.

# To use this configuration file, specify Shasta option
# "--config AbsolutePathToThisFile".
# If you specify any conflicting values on the command line,
# the values specified on the command line take precedence.

# In most cases, for best performance on a large assembly
# you will usually also want to use the following options, which 
# cannot be specified in a configuration file:
# --memoryMode filesystem
# --memoryBacking 2M
# Using these options requires root access.

# For detailed information on all available options see here:
# https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/shasta/CommandLineOptions.html

# For information on running a small assembly for which 
# performance is not essential see here:
# https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/shasta/QuickStart.html
