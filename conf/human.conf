# Shasta configuration file suitable for
# a human assembly with coverage around 40x.
# Such a run will require a machine with approximately 800 GB of RAM.

# If running on AWS EC2, a instance type x1.16xlarge is recommended
# and the assembly should take under one day to complete.
# This instance type has on demand price around $7/hour, 
# spot price around $2/hour.

# Most of the memory must be configured to use Linux huge pages (2 MB pages). 
# This can be done using shasta-install/bin/SetupHugePages.py.

# This file must be copied to the run directory and named shasta.conf.
# It can be edited as needed to experiment with assembly parameters.

# This file is only seen by Python scripts, not by C++ code.
# All parameters are passed to C++ code via arguments.



[Reads]

[Kmers]

# This section contains parameters that control the
# generation of k-mers to be used as markers.

# When useRunLengthReads is False, suggested choice is k = 8.
# When useRunLengthReads is True, suggested choice is k = 10.

# The base 2 log of the number of buckets used by the MinHash

# for highly repetitive sequence.

# The minimum number of aligned markers in an alignment
# in order for the alignment to be considered good and usable.
minAlignedMarkerCount = 100

# The maximum number of trim markers tolerated at the

# up this number of markers between the first/last aligned marker

[MarkerGraph]

# This section contains parameters that control
# the creation and processing of the global marker graph.

# The minimum and maximum coverage (number of markers)
# for a vertex of the marker graph.

# away and not generated by computeMarkerGraphVertices.
