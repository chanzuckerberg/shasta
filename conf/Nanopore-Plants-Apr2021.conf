# This was used in April 2021 for an assembly of Lolium Perenne
# under the following conditions:

# - Oxford Nanopore reads, basecalled with Guppy 4.0.14.
# - Coverage: 30x.
# - Reads N50: 62 Kb. 

# The assembly was run:

# - Using Shasta at commit 266d4c8e65ff408db2dfd1381bb14648be83dad3.
# - On AWS Graviton2 (ARM) r6g.16xlarge instance type, 512 GB, 64 vCPUs.
# - Using memory options --memoryMode filesystem --memoryBacking 2M.

# Assembly results:

# - Assembled 2.185 Mb of sequence. Estimated genome size 
#   is 2.46 Gb from k-mer analysis, 2.72 Gb from flow cytometry.
# - Assembly N50: 5.5 Mb.
# - Elapsed time for assembly: 95 minutes.

# Many thanks to Dario Copetti (Molecular Plant Breeding, ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
# for providing access to the reads in advance of publication. 

# Also see Shasta issue #200 for some discussion
