# Default configuration file for a Shasta assembly.
# The intent is that this will be tuned for a
# human assembly from Oxford Nanopore reads and coverage around 60x.
# Assembly parameter changes may be necessary
# for optimal performance under different conditions.

# Usage documentation is accessible here:
# https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/shasta/

# For information on how to set up a test run for which
# performance is not essential see here:

[Reads]

# Flag to select the read representation to be used.
# False: raw read representation.
# True: run-length read representation.
# For more information, see comments in src/Assembler.hpp,
# before the definition of reads.
# Do not change this, as the code is transitioning 
# to always use the run-length representation.

# are skipped on input.

[Kmers]

# This section contains parameters that control the
# generation of k-mers to be used as markers.

# of k-mers that will be used as markers.

# (in both oriented reads).

# The minimum number of aligned markers in an alignment
# in order for the alignment to be considered good and usable.
minAlignedMarkerCount = 100

# The maximum number of trim markers tolerated at the

# up this number of markers between the first/last aligned marker
# and the beginning/end of either oriented read
# for an alignment to be considered good and usable.

[ReadGraph]

# This section contains parameters that control

[MarkerGraph]

# This section contains parameters that control

# and for some types of analyses, but it slows down the assembly
# and uses additional huge page memory.
