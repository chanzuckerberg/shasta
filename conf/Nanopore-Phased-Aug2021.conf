# EXPERIMENTAL configuration file that uses assembly mode 2
# to create a phased diploid assembly.

# Suitable for Guppy 5.0.7 reads at coverage 40x to 80x. 

# Same as Nanopore-Sep2020.conf, except for the following:
# - Added options to use assembly mode 2.
# - Removed options that are not relevant for assembly mode 2.
# - Bayesian consensus caller for Guppy 5.0.7.
