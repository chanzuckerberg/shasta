The goal of the Shasta long read assembler is to rapidly 
produce accurate assembled sequence using as input DNA reads
generated by [Oxford Nanopore](https://nanoporetech.com) flow cells.

Computational methods used by the Shasta assembler include:

* Using a
[run-length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding)
representation of the read sequence.
This makes the assembly process more resilient to errors in
homopolymer repeat counts, which are the most common type
of errors in Oxford Nanopore reads. 

* Using in some phases of the computation a representation
of the read sequence based on *markers*, a fixed
subset of short k-mers (k â‰ˆ 10).

As currently implemented, Shasta can run an assembly 
of a human genome at coverage around 60x
in about 5 hours using a single, large machine (AWS instance type
`x1.32xlarge`, with 128 virtual processors and 1952 GB of memory).
The compute cost of such an assembly is around $20 at AWS spot market or reserved prices.

Shasta assembly quality is comparable or better 
than assembly quality achieved by other long read assemblers -
see [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/715722v1)
for an extensive analysis.
