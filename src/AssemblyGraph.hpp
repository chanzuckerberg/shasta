/***************************************************************************

The assembly graph is a "compressed" version of the marker graph,
in which each linear chain of edges is replaced by a single edge.

Each assembly graph vertex  corresponds to a marker graph vertex,
but the reverse is not true, because marker graph vertices
that are internal to a linear chain of edges don't have a corresponding
vertex in the assembly graph.
