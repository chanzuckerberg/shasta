/*******************************************************************************

The conflict read graph is an undirected graph in which each vertex
corresponds to an oriented read. Therefore, a read is associated with
two vertices, one for each orientation (Strand).

We create an undirected edge between two vertices if we found a bad
induced alignment alignment between the corresponding oriented reads.
The existence of the bad induced alignment indicates that, even though
the two oriented reads are close in the read graph, they are likely
to originate from different regions of the genome.

We use approximate coloring of the conflict graph to separate reads
based on the regions of the genome they originate from.
This is used to prevent tangles in the marker graph and in the assembly,
where two or more similar region of the genome come together due to
sequence similarity.
